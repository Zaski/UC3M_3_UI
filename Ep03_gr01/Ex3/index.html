					<p class="description">Taipei is the national capital of Taiwan. It is in the northern part of the island in a basin between the Yangming Mountains and the Central Mountains. It is, with 2.6 million inhabitants, the fourth largest administrative area of Taiwan, after New Taipei, Kaohsiung and Taichung. However, the Greater Taipei metropolitan area, which encompasses the central Taipei City along with the surrounding New Taipei City and Keelung, represents the largest urban cluster in Taiwan with nearly 7 million people. Taipei serves as the island's financial, cultural and governmental centre.</p>

						<h3>How to arrive?</h3>
							<div id="arrivingAccordion">
								<h3>By Plane</h3>
									<div>
									<br><br>
									If you are coming into Taipei, most likely you are flying into Taiwan's Taoyuan International Airport (TPE), Taoyuan airport is not strictly in Taipei, it is around 45 minutes south of Taipei, in Taoyuan county.
									<br><br>
									Taoyuan airport has 2 terminals, with similar services (Taxi, Bus, etc) from both terminals.
									<br><br>
									There is a regional airport, SongShan (TSA), which is in Taipei city.  However, it mostly services local domestic destinations and cities in China or Japan.
									<br><br>

						<h3>Transport</h3>
							<div id="innerTransportAccordion">
								<h3>From Taoyuan Airport</h3>
									<div id="taoyuanAccordion">
										<h3>By Bus</h3>
											<div>
											The best and most economical way to get to Taipei from Taoyuan airport is by bus.  There are many Airport buses that take you to the Taipei main station, with drop off points along the route at major hotels and MRT (metro) stations.
											<br><br>
											Once you are in Taipei, you can catch a cab to your hotel.
											<br><br>
											Some bus options from Taipei airport. 
											<br><br>
											Toward You Air Bus :   This route takes longer to get from airport to downtown, as it makes many stops.  Buses are not very well kept, dusty inside, greasy head rest area, dirty floor, and seats are cramped with very limited leg room (smaller than airlines economy class).  
											<br><br>
											Taiwan Bus Corp. (Kuokuang) :   Friendly bus driver, new and clean bus and wide seats with plenty of legroom.  Ticket price is TWD125. Take the KuoKuang bus if your hotel is in the vicinities of Zhongshan, Taipei Main Station/HSR Terminal and Ximending.
											<br><br>
											CitiAir Bus (DaYou): Take this bus if your hotel is near Taipei City Hall or Taipei 101 in the Xinyi Disrict (such as Grand Hyatt, Le Meridien, W Hotel, Agora Garden, Tango Xinyi), or in the Da'an vicinity (such as Far Eastern Plaza, Howard Plaza). Ticket price is TWD145. Be prepared to load and unload your luggage yourself.
											<br><br>
											Evergreen Bus:  This bus service is run by EVA Air and shuttles between Taoyuan, Nanjing East MRT, Zhongxiao Fuxing MRT and Evergreen Hotel. Ticket price is TWD150 but the comfortable ride and friendly service more than makes up for the marginally higher ticket price.
											<br><br>
											Freego Bus: Take this bus if your hotel is in the vicinities of Zhongxiao Fuxing and Nanjing East/Taipei Arena, such as San Want Hotel and Sunworld Dynasty Hotel. Ticket price is TWD140. 
											<br><br>

											</div>
										<h3>By High Speed Rail (HSR)</h3>
											<div>The airport is very close to the HSR station.  You can catch a 5-minute shuttle from eith airport terminals (green Ubus)  to the HSR station.  Buses run every 10-15 minutes from 7:00 am to 23:45 at night.
											<br><br>
											Once at the HSR station, buy a ticket to Taipei.  The HSR will stop at the Taipei Main Station, where you can connect with the MRT (metro).
											<br><br>
											<a class="source" href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Travel-g293913-s301/Taipei:Taiwan:Arriving.And.Departing.html">Source</a>
											</div>
										<h3>By Taxi</h3>
											<div>Unless you are arriving very late at night, or have a lot of luggage, there is no real reason to catch a Taxi.  A taxi from the airport to the city center will be around NT$1200, maybe a bit more depending on traffic.
											<br><br>
											<a class="source" href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Travel-g293913-s301/Taipei:Taiwan:Arriving.And.Departing.html">Source</a>
											</div>
									</div>
								<h3>From Song Shan Airport</h3>
									<div id="songShanAccordion">
										<h3>By MRT (Metro)</h3>
											<div>SongShan airport is served by the MRT, Neihu line, SongShan airport station, which can get you to any downtown destination.
											<br><br>
											<a class="source" href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Travel-g293913-s301/Taipei:Taiwan:Arriving.And.Departing.html">Source</a>
											</div>
										<h3>By Taxi</h3>
											<div>As SongShan airport is in Taipei, a taxi to any downtown hotel would be around NT$200.
											<br><br>
											<a class="source" href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Travel-g293913-s301/Taipei:Taiwan:Arriving.And.Departing.html">Source</a>
											</div>
										<h3>By Bus</h3>
											<div>The bus system in Taipei is harder to work out for a foreigner compare to the MRT.  There are busses that service SongShan airport, if you are looking to catch a bus, the best option would be to ask your hotel what connections you should take.
