From the analysis of this particular case, we can extract the following conclusions:

- The system to purchase goods online is pretty intuitive for people with experience with online stores. However, it is a little less intuitive if you are a newcomer to online stores. The existence of a lot of option might be counter-productive for people only looking for a "search" and a "buy" button.
- The system guides you through the process of buying step by step, with buttons whose names are logical ("Search" for a search bar, "Add to cart" to add items to the online cart...). Maybe, for people with not that much of a experience in the world of Internet, a message explaining the utility of each button while the cursor is over would be useful.
- Although the steps for recursive visitors are only a few, newcomers to Amazon are required to provide a lot of information. It is indeed necessary, but might be somehow tiring. The first purchase takes longer.
- The choice of a step-by-step process seems to be a good choice, as it allows the usage of simple steps instead of a too-long and too-tiring single step.
- Advertisements for featured sometimes make the interface to be too annoying, substracting space in the screen and importance to the product you are looking for. However, the addition of a "similar to this product" space sometimes is quite useful.
- Advanced search options are small and might not be noticed if the customer is not looking for them explicitly.

These conclusions could be reunited in a single conclusion that summarizes the overall idea Amazon's interface transmits to customers:

- A lot of options that might not be used can make the interface less intuitiv. Also, sometimes the advertisements of featured products gets annoying. However, the step-by-step interface guides the customer through the process of buying in Amazon with a maybe necessarily tirng but efficient process.
